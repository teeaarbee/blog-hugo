As you might have noticed in the last few blogs I have been very consistent with my habit of running, waking-up time, and even reading.

Thanks to my habit of setting goals in the blog, 
<br>PS: I have even been meditating around 10mins since Monday.

Ngl those are some impressive habits to have even for a big memelord like me 👉😎👈 XD JK

When I started writing here **I did not expect** all these changes to come so easily, 

**My aim** for writing my **blogs** has been to archive my past publicly for the future, 
<br>My target audience are bots from the future who will go through all the stuff and simplify it for other humans who wants to know about my past. 

I don’t think I have ever shared this publicly but yes this is the aim and I understand how far-sighted and optimistic this goal is, 
<br>I mean if I don’t become famous or something in the future 😹 No one is going to read. 

But unfortunately, if I do end up becoming one then I hope these blogs will serve as a guide to being awesome like TRB 😎👈 to the people of the future.
So part of the reason as to why I think I have been so successful with all these is because I have shared about it here with you all, which kinda made me more accountable.

But what’s more interesting part is how my lifestyle has slowly changed from the time that I started writing weekly blogs.

If you read my blogs from July and August, you will see how I didn’t do any of these but always kinda wanted to do it, and so I started to implement one change at a time slowly optimizing and sharing it all through my blogs.

The self-help arch of my lifestyle is pretty evident to anyone reading my blogs, I won't say like it was unplanned, because in my mind I have always been optimistic about the future, and so making all these changes like waking up early and stuff was always my goal.
<br>But writing about it here has helped me achieve those faster than I anticipated.

Unfortunately, I don’t have any one-action solution for anyone reading my blogs, but I hope if you keep reading them overtime I can slowly inspire you to become a little better. Because change according to me comes after we are exposed to an idea over a certain amount of time.
<br>Not a promise or anything it's just that I think if I continue writing not only will I get better at writing but I will also be able to express my ideas much nicely, which as of now I am not that good at yet.

This blog is basically like an **update blog** and I just wanted to share how happy I have been with the positive changes in my life which I partially attribute to my blogs, ofc I took the decision of writing them every week despite a lot of confusions and so far the decision has been very fruitful.

I started writing this particular blog with hope of sharing like a embedded google sheet link of my meditation and running stats live-update-summary. 
<br>But I think I am better off sharing those in my [weekly highlights](https://blog.teeaarbee.com/categories/weekly-highlights) rather than some all in one link here. 

🤔 

Lemme know if I should like make a link/blog like where you can see my report daily. Not sure if that will be a great idea even though that was among my this week’s goal lol.

Thanks for reading this short update blog, stay tuned for this week’s blog on Sunday, even though I don’t have anything interesting to share this week 🥱 Just like every other week ahahahaha.

Before signing off I would like to clear one more thing and that is my aim was to never look at people who read my blogs now because like I said it's targeted to the future, but I can’t help but notice people who read it now and appreciate me for it, I have also received quite a few heartwarming messages on Instagram of people saying how they enjoy reading my blogs 
and I am like “bruh😹 plus some insecurity wale lines.txt” 🥱 

The thing is I am not looking for gaining audience or something with these blogs and that Is why I don’t promote it aggressively, still sometimes I get influenced by others and end up sharing links in my insta story 😤 which is fine i guess I can promote these blogs once in a while in my profile, as long as it attracts only people who know me because I am afraid of people coming and saying “kya show off kar rha hain” 

These blogs are not for showing off I just try to share my mini achievements which I work hard on and I hope it inspires others too, I understand some of it seems very basic to others and some very complicated but its not the task that I want to promote it’s the mental model behind achieving those and I think it's going to take some time for anyone new at it.

So before I close this blog I would like to thank each and every one of you who comments on/ reads my blogs. 
<br>These blogs are in their infancy now and I hope you enjoy seeing them slowly evolve as much as I am going to.

Maybe in the future if I do a giveaway or something, I can be a little biased towards ya’ll 😈

It’s a joke but 
> *I thought I didn’t need you guys till you guys showed up 🤧❤*

so **Thank you !!!**
