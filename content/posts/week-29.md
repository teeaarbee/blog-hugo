Well Hello Everyone, This time I am on time 😾

Giving a full fledged review of job wont be possible but I will try and give a first impression hands on ***inserts a tech review video keyword*** 

## Personal Highlights 
-	**WRITING UPDATE**

I remember promising last week that I would write everyday and try and hit 1500 words target, So just like I had promised I did write everyday

but wasn’t able to hit that number instead I wrote around 946 words, which is less but there wasn’t much to write about this week as I was mostly busy with work.

I am happy that I atleast wrote everyday the goal was just an arbitrary number you guys.

PS: Its harder to run in the cold.

-	**MUSIC UPDATE**

I did practise keyboard almost everyday but I don’t think I had as much fun as the week before … for some reason I felt it a bit more challenging to enjoy this week.

Forgot to wear band on tuesday 👆

Honestly I think sleep is what saved me from burning out this week, I tried to sleep 7-8 hours everyday and even slightly improved my time. I am not yet back at sleeping at 9 but I was able to bring it down to 10pm and sleeping did really help me recover from headache and backpain.


Which brings us to 

Q. Why did you have backpain TRB? 
<br>Itna Jayda kaam de dea kya unhone 🥺
	
- And to which I would said not really it was just my first week so yes work did feel a bit overwhelming esp doing the same thing everyday, which I am not very much used to… 

The next 4 months are going to be challenging for sure but I am sure I will very soon adapt to it and will become more efficient.
Well that was the work part now coming to the co-worker part

There aren’t a lot of members like how I had guseed it’s a v small team and people are really good and friendly, esp because its small and everyone is young... almost of my age.

It will be to fun to see how this work thing works out in the long run.

If you ask me now, I would say I will probably quit after 4 months from now 😝
<br>But I will give myself more time to explore this route which I have selected for the next few months.

PS : 4 month is my Contract’s time duration/ after that I will either get a full time job or get kicked out 🥱

Also here's my this year's weekly time log sheet

##Thoughts from the past week

Something related to my new job …
So now that I have internet co-workers I am confused which side to show them, the IRL me or the virtual TRB.

Making online co-workers friends is like adding a new dimension to your life
<br>Like before this there were 2 dimensions of social friendship: IRL friends and online friends 
<br>But now there’s a new set of friends whom I am confused which side to show ... 

Gotta make a new personality I guess 😋

##Opinions 

Stop normalizing begging for subs

##Social Media updates 

https://twitter.com/teeaarbee/status/1350423087586500609

The next week is going to be very busy as I have said yes to a week long side hustle project.

So I have decided to **take my time off social media** for the next week.

Gonna do a **social media detox** for a week and since I will have a lot of work. I don’t even have to think of ways to distract myself.

PS: Sorry wont be able to edit the music mashup this next week either because someone has become capitalism ka sikhaar 😞
<br>Will prolly get it done in feb I guess.

Ayy remember I shared one his tweet thread last week in my quote section and this week I was able to edit a video featuring him.

He has a nice [YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/warikoo/videos) and has recently switched to making videos on startup and finance so I recommend everyone to check out his channel if you are slightly into information consuming side of the spectrum. 

The two videos that I edited featuring him : [This on habits](https://bit.ly/2XQE272) and This on [journaling](https://bit.ly/2M4qlyQ).

###Apps & Services 📱 
>[Descript](https://kutt.it/ZfsYLw)

I was given this tool at my work and we use it to generate subtitles for videos 
<br>But it can do much more than that and is very beginner friendly.

If you want to edit videos but don’t like the traditional layout of video editing softwares, then give this app a try, You can just edit the words that you spoke in text format in this software and it will edit the video with ref to that.
Watch the tutorial on their home page if you didn’t get it 🤠

Didn’t finish any podcast but I did listen to the audio book [Tools of titans](https://amzn.to/2K5MUm2) for at least 10 mins every day.

###Quotes from the week📃

I actually listed to a lot of great quotes in The tools of titans audiobook but forgot to note them down ☹ 
<br>I guess I will share them in the future 

For now here’s a series of tweet by @G_S_Bhogal

https://twitter.com/G_S_Bhogal/status/1225561131122597896

Now you and me both know that none of us going to read the entire thing XD at least not for now.. and that is why I am sharing it here, after few years from now when you decide to revisit this particular blog maybe you will come across this and have a read and maybe then we will understand some of the tweets in this thread 😌

##Goal(s) for the next week 🥅
Like I said above I will be very busy from tomorrow on as I will doing basically a lot of work.

So I don’t think I have any goal for this week other than social media detox, 

The reason I am doing a detox this week is because time Is very valuable to me this week and if I don’t give up on a few things I wont be able to give my 100% at work and might even stop doing few of my core habits. So to prevent that I will be logging out of all social media sites tonight.

----

See you next week it wont be a lot as I will be spending my time off social media sites, but still I will write something 😌
Thanks for reading this week’s blog, hope you found something of value from it.
