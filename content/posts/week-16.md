I would like to begin this blog by announcing that **I was able to wake up at 5 am every day** this week. 

And waking up at 5 made was a game changer for me.

## Personal Highlights
-	Starting off with review of the goals of last week <br>
	**I was able to complete most of them.** 
-	But I wasn‚Äôt able to make any content for my main page :( I know I made the announcement of returning to my main page, but unfortunately life had other plans for me. 

- And I cant even complain about it as I got a very big project / opportunity sort of <br>
‚óò	Basically, its an **editing project** for a very big company and I will also be paid well. <br>
    ‚óò Lmao I had a lot of plans for my main page but now I don‚Äôt know if I will be able to pull them off properly, still I will try my best and try coming up with an efficient solution to my time management problem. <br>
    ‚óò So for now I will be prioritizing *that gig over my main page*, and **isn't a permanent** thing.. so once i am done with that or with part of it i will make something for my page. it sure is going to be hard trying to handle so many things at a time. so don't mind if I dont upload for next few weeks üòî Man should'nt have made that annoucement last week I guess XD

-	And yes **waking up at 5am** was really a big part of this week and I was able to wake up before 5:30 almost everyday. <br>
‚óò	And to achieve it I went to bed at around 9pm everyday, just to hit that sweet **8 hours sleep** mark. <br> 
‚óò	I have tried and tested my sleep schedule by waking up at different times and thus far this one is the best. 
    I will write an entire blog on it by the end of this month.
-	Now about my fitness update <br>
‚óò	For the first few days I went for a walk early morning but then I switched to running in the 2nd half of the week and ‚Ä¶ it was actually quite easy for me to get back to running. <br>
‚óò	I increased my running distance from **1km to 2km**, I aim to get back to 5km like before by mid-November. 
##Thoughts from the past week
Damn where da thots go wen u need me üòî

##Opinions 
-	Someone who is new to a thing can‚Äôt contribute to it significantly 

Take example of a very young artist, let‚Äôs say he/she is very talented when it comes to drawing and has drawn a few beautiful pictures, but he cant compete in any sense compete with the older artist because making something of value consistently requires a lot of experience and now matter how hard they try they will always be beaten by the older experienced artist in the long run. 

So what I think they should do is they should shut the fuck up and focus on enjoying the process and creating content and not chase growth.

I feel like growth will automatically come when they learn to deliver value slowly overtime and like I said it requires a lot of experience which loosely translates to they have to invest a lot of time and energy into it.

I don‚Äôt know why I am so salty about beginners and newbie, I just don‚Äôt like when someone with less experience wants to grow rapidly in a field where they aren‚Äôt much experienced. 

##Social Media updates
No updates other than a few tweets and insta stories.

I wanted to share the tweet but it wasn‚Äôt well phrased, but it got 60 likes so I guess people understood it üòé I mean after all likes determine the validity of claim in today‚Äôs society amirite!?! 

##My Favourites from the Week 
###Blog/Article
I did not get much time to read articles exclusively because everytime I wanted to read I picked up homo deus and read that book instead still I will share something similar to what I was reading in that book
- [The Great War of Morality and Ethics](https://kutt.it/cFy4Su) by Aniket

Tweeted this out for experimental purposes only but i was genuinely blown away with the amount of knowledge prakhar had in his head, I used to think of him as someone who copied book summaries from various website but turns out I was wrong XD 

Lowkey wish to join but i am nowhere near that knowledgable yet, maybe in the future üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### App 
I recently switched to [qbittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) from utorrent as utorrent was getting detected as virus by windows defender, could have been a false alarm but I was tired of the ads anyway so qbittorrent is a much better and ad free open source alternative.

##Goal(s) for the next week
Not sure about what I should set up for next week as this week was a huge success XD
-	But one of the thing that I am planning to do is not connecting  mobile to internet after waking up, instead I will do that after I return from my run idk if I will be able to pull this off or not.

-	Another goal will be to implement the pomodoro technique to my work because i have been getting distracted a lot lately.

Thanks for reading my blog till the very end, I am quite excited and concerned about next week as I will be completing my first video of the big project and that will kinda determine if that work will continue or not, both from their end and mine.
