Sorry for the super late blog, this was supposed to be published on Sunday and I am writing this on a Tuesday ü•∂

This is the first time in a while that I have delayed writing my blog that too for no big reason, I mean there is a small reason and that is I was busy watching x-men
## Personal Highlights 

Overall, this week was better than last week in terms of me keeping up with my habits.

I removed the individual update part from this week‚Äôs blog as the blog is late already and it‚Äôs still nowhere near to what it used to be but I am sure it will come back eventually and for that I have a diff. approach which I will be sharing below in the goals section. 

- Also. I **finished reading** 

    <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32501719-so-good-they-can-t-ignore-you" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px"><img border="0" alt="So Good They Can't Ignore You" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1475957457l/32501719._SX98_.jpg" /></a><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32501719-so-good-they-can-t-ignore-you">So Good They Can't Ignore You</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/147891.Cal_Newport">Cal Newport</a><br/>
My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3815437348">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Very practical book!<br />This was the 3rd cal n. book that I read and found it quite helpful in terms of finding answers to a lot of job related dilemmas.<br />I mean i might not be able utilize it fully myself but will be able to give the advice to someone else ü§≠<br />overall its a nice book if you are struggling with finding passion for your work maybe pair this up with flow by mihaly csikszentmihalyi and you will most probably not get bored with your work.

Idk which book to start next. I am confused between ego is the enemy and obstacle is the way.

- Also I started a new habit last week and that is of **voice journaling**, every evening I record a voice journal of me speaking for 3-5mins. Now I have tried doing these earlier but I have never been quote consistent with it but now with [Avalon voices](https://avalon-voices.app.link/hfzIaRrdEeb) coming into the picture I decided to take improving my speaking skills a bit more seriously and that is why I started audio journaling.

I will talk more about this habit and avalon voices in the upcoming blogs.

- Btw I also got a haircut this week after like 13months and this is the first time in my 22 year life that I let my hairs grow for this long, usually I get  em cut within a month or two and I always keep short hair like john cena ü§≠

    But it was kinda nice(and itchy) to let my hairs grow.

    Anyway I don‚Äôt miss my hairs tbh, rather I feel more productive now because I don‚Äôt have to think about drying my hairs everyday after bath

    I did not feel light after getting my hair cut idk why but it felt like someone tied my hairs very tightly XD

## Thoughts from the past week

- Most of my thoughts this week is around the theory of dots that I wrote this week and published it‚Äôs first part, I will write more on it in the coming weeks and expand it in a way that its more easily understandable.

- I have also been promoting it a bit not because I want a lot of views and shit but because promoting/ marketing of a content is a skill and I might not need it now but once I do develop the skills it will come in handy. 

    I still try to keep promotions very subtle and low. 

    Maybe I need to write a blog on my take at promotion üòà

## Opinions 

Teenagers should not get a lot of attention for sharing generalised advice online.

## Social Media updates 
I had planned to post something but like I said I got busy watching x-men and so didn‚Äôt get the time to make it.

## How I improved my blogs 
Not much this week but I am planning to make a blog cover image template.

This is the first Ali Abdaal podcast that I listened to and I absolutely loved it, it had a very conversation centric vibe instead of the usual value centric vibe of his video and I enjoyed it a lot.
Also I liked his brother‚Äôs diff take on a few things quite a bit.

## Goal(s) for the next week ü•Ö
So like I said above I will take a different approach this week and that approach will be to
-	Just focus on one habit which will be **going to bed on time**, I should be on bed by 10pm every night and then maybe spend the next 30mins reading something.
-	The reason I am choosing this over others is that after some analysis I found out that my keystone habit is going to bed on time, when I go to bed on time I have the energy to read a bit and most importantly I wake up early which ensure that I go for my run.
So a single habit to sleeping early ensures 2 other habits and going for a run automatically makes my whole day 2x more productive and I also feel great throughout the day.
