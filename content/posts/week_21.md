Just finished 4 months of consistent blogging😳

Also writing this on Saturday, because I will be super busy tomorrow. 

## Personal Highlights 
-	Nothing fancy, completed all the goals from last week except making overall stats public, but I did write a blog on that, so do check it out.
-	Also Meditated for around 10mins every day, I used an app called calm as I found the natural white noise of birds chirping and water falling quite helpful but its not my final choice, I will be experimenting with other apps too,

The goal for now is to just continue meditating everyday, regardless of any app or external factors. 

Also like I said the only reason why I am using an app is because I want to share my stats at the end of every week so here is my meditation stat from this week.
-	And here’s my running stat

Idk why but this week I didn’t feel as energetic as last week and got tired quicker, last week I was able to run for 3KM every day and some days I felt like running a bit more, but this week I was kinda sloppy still I am glad I did complete 5 runs this week, Totaling 42Km this month which btw leaves only 8Km to be completed before the end of the month lol 😎 [Monthly goal ref]

-	Btw also completed the selfish gene and now I am confused which book to read next 🤔
Will put a poll on insta and then make decision from voting in that poll from my other accounts 😜

##Thoughts from the past week 🧠

When we see someone **trying to be funny**, he/she automatically becomes **unfunny**.

It is because of the core principal that humour is based on which is **subversion of expectations** so when we expect something to be funny it will be harder for us to laugh at it because of our expectation.

In that case we can always lower expectations but if that doesn’t work then we can try and laugh at it on a deeper level, here comes the act of switching levels of humour/irony, so what we can do is laugh at their though process, obviously to do this you will need to be familiar with humour and jokes to understand everything at such a deeper level at the humour comes from things that they didn’t expect, but given the fact that you are an over smart judgemental piece of shit who decided to judge someone trying to make you laugh you should be able to do it.
This same thing can be seen on memes that are based on 3-4 layers of irony. 

I will continue this on my dedicated blog about humour. And will go much more in-depth so if you did not understand this, I don’t think you will understand that either XD JK 

##Opinions 🥶

Opinions should keep changing overtime.

##My Favourites from the Week 
###Blog/Article 📑
-	[Speed matters: Why working quickly is more important than it seems](https://kutt.it/oHh0KX)

This was my fav blog from the week, I instantly realized why I was procrastinated and hurried to get my pending work completed once again thanks to satendra for sending this.
-	[How Experts Figure What to Focus On](https://kutt.it/at7kNE)

How I am tryna be 🤑
-	[3 Surprising Reasons Why You Need to Rediscover Slow Growth](https://kutt.it/kcM0w7)

Came across this when i thought of entering matt deivela's slow growth course competition 😓

###VIDEOS 📺
I watched **Wolf of the wall street**, liked the movie but didn’t like the life story of the man, and the fact how he became an e-guru selling courses in the end was kinda sad XD

Few YT videos that i liked this week:

###Creator 🤹🏻
**[Arpit Bala](https://kutt.it/qj07xl)**

I knew him from his <a href="https://kutt.it/arpitonig" target="_blank">Insta page</a>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/A3KK1iE.png" alt="arpit on ig" style="max-width: 600px;width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 10px 0;" >
But I had no idea he had this channel about which I came to know after listening to his PBTB podcast [linked below]

###Apps 📱 
> [Calm](https://www.calm.com/)

I used it to track my meditation, thankfully it syncs data over cloud and even shows my stats in my pc which is kinda nice. 

I think headspace is better than this so I ll give it a try next week

###Podcast 🎙

I listened to a lot of podcasts this week, I will be sharing all of them below
- Firstly I listened to the 2nd part of prakhar’s PBTB podcast 

<iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/3xBvgL1igRaIUv2ooLABdu" width="100%" height="232" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>

And was quite sad about ocus being sad with the gyaan chodne wale comments so I talked to him insta DMs main and gave him few trb tips & trix which he already knew, but I am sure I made those ideas even stronger in his head hehe 

- Next I listed to arpit bala’s PBTB podcast and holyshit was I surprised by the fact that he as a YouTube channel, where he made like well edited and scripted videos… was very impressed by it.

Also it was cute how ocus said he was fan of arpit bala 🤭🤭
Btw both arpit and ocus were familiar with my work and knew me[they were my fans🤫] from memes 😏💅 again not showing off 🤭😎 But its always nice to be known by people you follow.
PS: pata nhi yeh #*@%&$# rav kab follow karega mujhe 🤬

- And then I listened to my fav podcast from the week/ month on Thursday by PG Radio 

<iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/2CklZVXCYLM3sqjsQJpCmQ" width="100%" height="232" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>

And it was Prakhar and Varun maya talking about Indian education system and stuff and I have been following varun after I was bombarded with his ads of avlon meta but this was the first time I listened to him talk for a long duration of time and I was very very impressed actually impress is an understatement I got sort of inspired tbh.

His words together with prakhar’s felt like a nourishment to the mind, they discussed so many beautiful ideas absolutely loved each and every bit of it esp all the neuroscience related stuff 😭

###Quotes from the week📃

###Memes/Edits/Interesting stuff 🐒
According to the votes from last week’s poll, It seems like people wanted me to shift but I got a few comments saying they want me to keep the memes on the same page, so for now I have decided that I will only share top 3 memes / edits from the week here and rest I will link in a different page which I will link below

##Goal(s) for the next week 🥅
Now that I am all set with meditation reading and running, 
The next thing in my list was working out but that I will shift to next week

And my goal for this week will be to WRITE, 

Thanks to Arpit Bala(Podcast), I knew about his advice of free writing but the fact that he writes everyday motivated me to do the same.

However, all I will be writing will be my journal and I will try to write it right after I finish my dinner around 8. So that I can stick to it for longer. 

I am not new to writing but I have lost my habit of writing journal everyday so it will be nice to get started again. I hope free-writing journal finally awakens the writing ka keeda in me which will then result in me writing topic-based blogs hehe 😁
