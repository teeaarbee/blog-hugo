<!-- Had a few technical difficulties last week with the blog and was forced to remove the Instagram embeds. But its all fixed now, and you can go have a look at the [memes and edits featured last week](https://blog.teeaarbee.com/archives/week-16#memeseditsinteresting-stuff). -->

HelloðŸ˜Ÿ sorry for being late again this week.

Still dealing with the insta embed issue and thats what delayed this week's blog :(

## Personal Highlights
-	Hmm so both the **goals from last week** kinda **failed**. <br>
    â—˜ It was hard to cut off *phone usage* after waking up and I didnâ€™t feel like forcing myself.<br>
    â—˜ Now coming to the goal of using a **pomodoro** timer,
    <br>I tried using pomodoro but as it happened, <br>
    
    I would usually continue working past the timer without noticing it or I would get distracted regardless of it. <br>
    
    But I still want to continue using it properly in the future, it was in a way slightly helpful, I need to optimize its usage in accordance with my behaviours.

-	However, this week was truly epic in terms of **health and fitness** <br>
    â—˜ As I continued waking up at around 5:30am every day, and went for a run instead of walks. ðŸ˜Ž <br>
    â—˜ I ran like 9kms in total this week, I will attach screenshot below for additional flex ðŸ˜ŽðŸ–•

    <br>

-	Not just that I sort of developed a morning routine, which is probably the highlight of the month. <br>
So everyday after coming back from run, I shower and then instead of jumping to my computer/phone, I read a book for like 20-30mins

    And damn once I am done doing this ritual every day, I feel so satisfied.

    Expect a blog on my morning routine soon just like yall have been expecting topic based blogs for over 2 months now ðŸ˜¹

## Thoughts from the past week
I watched Mirzapur and Idk I kinda liked it maybe because I had really low expectations from it lmao. 

I still remember back in 2018 when Mirzapur was about to come out and their marketing agency tried to promote it via small meme pages [[I was among them](https://kutt.it/6ALIOX)]

Back then few of my meme friends thought it wouldnâ€™t work and here we are 2 years later, Almost everyone is posting stories of it,

What once felt liked forced promotion has now become so natural among everyone.

##Social Media updates
Made an ytff style intro for saiman[edited the source from yt :P]

And got a shoutout from him, which then prompted a lot of people to come check my main page and ðŸ¥± â€¦ boring ... moving on 

I posted highlights from [Homo Deus](https://amzn.to/2VCeTMJ) to my insta story.
<br>You can find them [here](https://kutt.it/trbhighlights)[original] or [here](https://kutt.it/2thiMm) if you aren't on instagram 


##My Favourites from the Week 
###VIDEOS

- https://youtu.be/-VlDS5LP7HQ?list=LL

- https://youtu.be/8_GJB1Ofrvs?list=LL

They hire good peeps to make the video. <br>
But They say itâ€™s a video essay on a movie but its like very biased towards the good, like in this video they didnâ€™t mention any negative aspects of the movie â€¦ just appreciated everything. Idk I wish there were Indian channels which made videos of this sort, well edited and scripted like this. ðŸ˜£
<br>

- https://youtu.be/Nz0qLMmdOg4?list=LL

Damn neural filters do be looking kinda phresh tho ðŸ˜³

- https://youtu.be/gtRqbbiWU30?list=LL

- https://youtu.be/MK1rQ36lziI?list=LL

- https://youtu.be/LiHCtRzT550?list=LL

I completed the series last week and found it very informative tbh, there were a lot of things that I didnâ€™t know. Sorry but I donâ€™t watch news ðŸ˜“

videos like these make me miss college ðŸ˜”

###Podcast 

https://soundcloud.com/jamesclear/james-clear-and-cal-newport

So for peeps who dont know, james clear and carl newport happen to be two of my favourite authors and this was like a nice crossover thingy for me.

I listened to this last Monday and hands down one of the best podcast, its short and full of value.

There aren't any other episodes just this one.

I can't **recommend** this enough, So if you get some free time then please listen to it.


###Bonus
So these are not exactly podcasts but I found em on spotify while searching for a podcast lmao

And from then it has became a part of my morning routine, I listen to them while running, summary of audio books arenâ€™t usually free and so it was quite surprising for me to find them on spotify.

These are the ones I listened to

##Goal(s) for the next week
-	Organize files and folders in pc, 1-2 folders a day and slowly start building a tree like hierarchy for all files on pc. 
- Continue the habit of reading everyday in morning.

Quite excited as we enter the last week of October, I wonder what realizations will stuck me and prompt me into taking life alter decisions this coming week ðŸŒˆ
