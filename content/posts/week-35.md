Finally back after a month!?!

Yes as you might have noticed no blogs came in the month of feb. and I explained the reason behind it in this blog which [I just published](https://blog.teeaarbee.com/archives/why-does-the-website-look-different/) along with this.
 
It also has the reason behind the blog looking different so go and read that first and then come back.
 
Also I am writing this on Monday evening XD so I am gonna keep this blog very short.

## Personal Highlights 
This last week wasn’t very “habit healty” I skipped a lot of my habits because of excess work which I took upon my ownself in the prior week #capitalist-greed moment 😣

Which led to me **almost burning out**, by sat night I wasn’t able to function properly XD

But then on Sunday I went out for lunch with my college friends after a while 😌 Like after 3-4 months and that led to me feeling a bit refreshed idk maybe 
it was mostly placebo but still I felt a lot better. 

But did I counter burnout or did I just snooze it for later ??? Only time will tell aka I will know the answer by the end of this week.

## Thoughts from the past week
I have a theory of dots and how I use that theory to understand the world around me and make sense of everything.

It’s a bit long so I will def. write a blog about it by the end of this week pakka promise.

## Opinions

## Social Media updates 
I posted one meme to my spam Insta everyday this week for the first time in more than a year.
However all of them were low effort shitpost and tbh not worth sharing.

If you still want to see see you can check my insta or [here](https://imgur.com/a/msOkoPW)
