I am writing this on 15th of feb instead of 14th because my last blog which I wrote on 7th hasn’t been published yet! Thanks to some technical error 😔 

We are trying to get it to work but not sure when the error will be fixed so till then I guess I will just continue writing without anyone reading it XD because I don’t want to break my 32 week long streak
## Personal Highlights 
So I am not sure if this week was better than last week in terms of me following my habits but I am much more saner this week thanks to comparatively less work this week 😌
-	**WRITING UPDATE**

I did not write everyday but I came up with a new journaling format which is helping me to write more.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2gUQBYx.png" alt="w33" style="
max-width: 600px;width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 10px 0;" >

I came to the realization that even though free writing can be a great pratise it usually limits me from organizing my thoughts and in general I write less when I am just freely writing. 

Here’s the format: <img src="https://i.imgur.com/rwBWjgc.png" alt="new eod format of journlaing" style="
max-width: 600px;width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 10px 0;" >

So just like my blog has an organized format, my daily journal has a new template now.

I would have shared the link to this template but I want everyone to make their own as that is much more helpful and helps build base knowledge too.

-	**READING UPDATE**

Read a bit less than last week because I got a new phone this week and I was busy with that XD

Also about to finish tools of titan audiobook. Might as well share a bit from it in the coming blogs.

-	**MEDITATION UPDATE**

Well this completely went out of my life this week 💀

Haha! Need to bring it back somehow let me see what I can do.

-	**MUSIC UPDATE**

Frequency was like last week only but I had installed rescuetime from my old phone so there is no data available. I hope it starts tracking the data again and hopefully it will be back next week.


-	**FITNESS UPDATE**

Same as last week :(( 


-	**SLEEP UPDATE**

Main reason why my run was affected this week is because I went to bed bit late and so didn’t wake up in time.

I have been getting a full proper sleep but I need to fix the timing.

-	**WORK UPDATE**

So like I said there was comparatively less work this week 😌

So there isn’t much to write about it but compared to last week I did improve my timing of delivery by a bit. 

Also I started planning my day via daily checklist on notion and it has been quite helpful too this week.
Here’s my format:


----

Btw talking about my new phone I bought POCO x3 as this was the best smartphone under 20k and tbh under 30k too as per my requirement. 

There was realme and other brands which offered Mediatek chipset and I really dislike mediatek because technical guruji planted that seed in my mind back in 2017 XD

Not only that the problem with non-snapdragon SOC is I wont be able to install custom roms and other latest android features because of compatibility and optimization issue so I went ahead with this 😌

## Thoughts from the past week

{{< tweet 1361255113432555520 >}}


I had this in my mind for a while but it recently came back when I listened to Malcom gladwell’s part in Tools of titans where he stated how he starts a book from somwhere in the middle.

This is also among some of my personal fav thoughts and I would love to expand more on it in the future.

I had a valentine’s day special sorta meme planned in my head which I could have posted to my main insta page had I not started watching scam on Friday.

Also posted few pics from my morning run earlier this week

### VIDEOS 📺
I saw a [sony LIV ad](https://youtu.be/QTCOR8krc2U?list=LL) saying that WWE network is coming to their platform so I took their subscription only to realize that wwe plan requires different additional payment ☠
So to make use of my subscription I decided to watch scam 1992 and finished it by Sunday.
It was nice and there were no sex scenes 😳 Overall the series has v nice performance  

Anyways here are few of my fav videos from the last week

### Apps 📱 
No new app this week despite getting a new phone this week I tried to stick to all the old apps that I am used to.
Let’s see if I come across any new ones.
Btw the apps that I shared last week were solid af and I found myself heavily relying on them this week.
