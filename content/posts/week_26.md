So here we are, **The last weekly highlight** of the year 2020

Not sure if this is the last blog of the year though, because I am planning to write a year in review type of blog like the one which [I wrote last year](https://teeaarbee.blogspot.com/2020/01/personal-rewind-2019.html).

## Personal Highlights 
Ok I am gonna ditch the new format for this week’s blog. 
<br>Because I failed in almost all of them except running and keyboard. 

<br>Will embed my spreadsheet below instead

The reason why I failed in most of it is 

1) Because I started working on my music mashup video

2) I was super happy this week XD

And just like super sadness, super happiness is distracting too 🤧

I am gonna share the reason behind my happiness at the very end, so keep reading or skip to the end idc 

##Thoughts from the past week
Didn’t think anything unique, all I thought of was my potential upcoming job  

##Opinions 
Resist trends, not change.

##Social Media updates

Hit 1k Followers on twitter 😎🕊

Did a livestream on my 2nd insta @ 25th  Dec where I kinda tried playing my keyboard, it was kinda bad and embarrassing but I enjoyed it so yeah 😌💆‍♂‍ 

**Music Mashup update**
<br>Anurag finally gave me the final version of the audio aaaaaand a part of it got copyrighted on yt. So we had to change it a bit to evade the system 😈
Will try my best to upload the video by 31st of this month 🤧

##Big Highlight from the week

Remember varun mayya ?

The one guy I talked about in my [week-24 blog](https://blog.teeaarbee.com/archives/week-24)

Ya so he tweeted out this

https://twitter.com/VarunMayya/status/1341321426515574784

To which I replied half-jokingly

https://twitter.com/teeaarbee/status/1341334138398261255


And then he actually contacted me on twitter 😳


Aaaaaaand I showed him my work, which Ig he liked and asked me if I wanted to join full time and lead a new video editing team 

Then we talked on call [confidential] XD jk there was nothing like that so I ll have to edit a sample video for him and if he likes it, he will hire me.

I wanted to make the sample video then and there but then I remembered that I have a music mashup to finish 🤧

So once I am done with that, I'll make the sample video for him [avalon] and

Let yall know next week if I get hired 💆‍♂‍

PS: If i get hired it will change everything and my life will head towards a completely new and different path.

I am happy about it now but i dont really know the long term consequence of it... Either way it will be fun to write about even if the blogs go through a phase of "this week i was 'busy' 'busy' 'busy'" to .... idk
