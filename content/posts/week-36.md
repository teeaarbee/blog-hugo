### New month same old shit
Its around 10:30pm of a nice Saturday night, I should have been asleep by now but here I am writing the blog because I really felt like writing also because I kinda want to make Sunday a bit less stressful.

## Personal Highlights 
So even this week sucked in terms of me getting back to maintaining my habits, reason being I kinda overworked last week so this week I guess my mind took a break.
But I am glad that I didn’t feel burnt out like last week.
-	**WRITING UPDATE**

I did not journal anything not only that I did not even write the blog I promised last week yet, I will write that first thing tomorrow morning hehe 😅

## Thoughts from the past week
Very random thoughts nothing specific tbh
Also kinda wanted to get some toys idk why

So I asked for suggestions on insta and got a lot of dms 
![Ig story stats]()
Most of it was Nerf gun, RC copter, Hotwheels, Action figures, Beyblade and Barbie Doll House 🤭🤭
I don’t really have enough money to mindlessly spend on these but these are surely going to my Wishlist and I will def. buy them in the future 😌🤲

## Opinions 
Don’t imitate people with high numbers

## Social Media updates 
Well after posting consistently for 8 days I stopped posting 

![Says a lot about society meme](https://i.imgur.com/fLWEF4E.png)

## How I improved my blogs 
Started sending email newsletter seriously.
If you haven’t check your emails then you can read them online [Here](http://newsletter.teeaarbee.com/) 
And if you subscribed to it then check the promotion tab of your email and move it to primary and maybe mark it as imp. 
Idk how else to trick gmail into believing that I am not selling anyrhing 😣
## My Favourites from the Week 
### Blog/Articles 📑

### VIDEOS 📺

### Apps 📱

I got secret access from the ceo himself 🤭 but yall can join the beta waitlist.

I will share a nice Invite link once its public 😌


PS: I posted a meme on insta as a joke I mean varun is in my whatsapp I didn’t have to make those effort to get the access but I still felt like making a bit of extra effort to see how many share the insta story gets.

## Goal(s) for the next week 🥅

I have been consistently failing at my goals 😭🤣 

So I don’t feel like keeping a goal this week, Will just try to improve chup chaap and not hope for it 🤐

However I do feel very optimistic about the coming week and hopefully this will help me in getting somewhat back to my usual habit streaking form.
