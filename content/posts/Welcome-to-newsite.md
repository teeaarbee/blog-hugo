### Hello everyone,
So finally, my first blog on my new [site](https://blog.teeaarbee.com) Yay XD


I am sorry if you don't know who i am, read the **[About me](https://blog.teeaarbee.com/about/)** section maybe :sleeping:  
>*[Idk why the emoji code didn't work but i'll figure it out soon and fill my blogs with lots of emojis]* ðŸ˜ˆ

Alright so for those of you who already know who i am this is my new blog site.

And as you might know, I am not very new to the world of blogging, I have tried my hands on blogging.

Last year you can check my old blogsite [here](https://teeaarbee.blogspot.com/)
However, it was hosted on google, and was much easier to operate but lacked the *aesthetics*.

However new website along with my [main website](https://www.teeaarbee.com), looks phresh.
All thanks to [Rohit](https://www.instagram.com/uiux.rohit/) 

###So what changes am i going to implement this time ?

I have decided to change things up a bit and use this website to recommend stuffs weekly about things that I find interesting, 
basically I am planning to use this site as my weekly public highlight/Documentary panel, idk if thatâ€™s a thing but yeah!

However, I will continue writing topic specific blogs occasionally, but the weekly highlight thing will be somewhat **consistent**.

>I might end up changing everything depending upon my mood.

Alright so thatâ€™s about it for this short blog, make sure you have subscribed to my email newsletter by clicking [here](https://teeaarbee.com/#blog). 
I have not yet learned to control it tho, so for the next few blogs I might announce via [my Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/teeeaaarbeee) stories.

As time passes on I will slowly develop this and [my main home page site](https://www.teeaarbee.com) to look more well organized and appealing. 
I realized it takes time and experience to build something great and no matter how many tweaks I make now, I wonâ€™t be able to get the results I am looking for, unless I allow time to pass and teach me more. 
With that being said, I hope to see you in the next one.

Also try reacting and or commenting *[You can comment anonymously use any random email you want]* below, 
Just for the sake of experimentation ðŸ˜—
