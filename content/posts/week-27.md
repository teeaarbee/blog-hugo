This year's first blog is delayed by a day 😄 great 😖
<br>Sorry for the delayed blog, I was busy reading and overthinking yesterday XD

There’s a small gift for y’all somewhere in the end of the blog, so continue reading 🤫

My job interview was supposed to happen way before, and this blog was supposed to come out yesterday with the results 
<br>But as it turns out, life isn’t that predictable.

But now I am finally writing this after the interview:
<br>I am glad I did not publish this blog yesterday and kept you all in anticipation…

There’s a saying that goes like “don't count your chickens before they hatch” and in the last 2 weeks I did not only count them, but I fed them grazed em and raised an entire farm in my head.

## Personal Highlights 

-	Since this year started midway through the week, I am going to skip my habit stat sharing ritual for this week and keep this blog short like the last one.
<br> However if you want to know my final week habit progress you can check the spreadsheet that I embedded last week. <br> PS: everything went downhill
-	The past week all I did was overthink about my job meeting and made sort of imaginary convos in my head that I would say and convince them to gimme a high salary XD
-	Also I wasn’t able to read anything throughout the week as my mind kept drifting but yesterday I completed an entire book [110 pages long] and guess the book ………

It was [Negotiate like an Avalonian: An arsenal of techniques to negotiate better salaries, deals and funding!]( https://amzn.to/38aJNlU) XD

I mean its not everyday that you get to read a book by the CEO of the company that you are going to apply for, on negotiating salary.
 
Update:
<br>The book that I read, did not come in any use.

##Opinions

##Social Media updates 

Ok here comes the truly sad part of the blog… 

I stopped working on music mashup video midway through the week because I got into editing the sample video. 

I will try and complete it slowly now, once all these job shit is out of my mind.
