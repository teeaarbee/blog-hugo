## Hi !! I am TRB or TEEAARBEE
![TRB-logo](https://i.vgy.me/hhSzCm.jpg)

But I suppose you dont have any trouble figuring that out unless you are an old machine. 
I am best known for uploading what people call Meme videos on the Internet. 
Even though I dont make them anymore, The skills that I learnt from making those are helping me earn some money i.e., via Video Editing.

Things that I am interested in: Psychology, Neuroscience, Philosophy, Art, History, Business and the list goes on.
So yes! I am sort of a generalist or better trying to be one.
I don't know where I am going to end up in a few years but if you want to know the answer to that then you can read blogs.
Which I publish every sunday. 
And maybe join My Discord/ Telegram Group or Email List and get notified everytime I post a blog. 
Links to everything can be found <a href="https://teeaarbee.com/#implinks">Here</a> 
Or at the very bottom of this page in the footer section.
Thank you! For taking your time to read about me.
